# Twitter Chrome Extension

In order to view the chrome extension in all its glory you'll want to pull or fork the repo. Then load the `extensions` folder located in the root directory of the app in to `chrome://extensions/`. Make sure that you have `developer mode` checked. Then click the `load unpacked extension` button located on the upper middle right of the screen, load the appropriate folder `twitter_extension/extension/` and viola you should be up and running. Next go to any website and click the grey twitter icon that popped up on the upper right of your chrome tab menu. the server is already up and running so theres nothing you would need to do other than load the extension.

For best results I would suggest going to popular sites like github.com, stackoverflow, even twitter.
